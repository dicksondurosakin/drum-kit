## About This Repository
This repository was created while I was taking the Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu. The webpage contains 7 images of different parts of a drum, by pressing the letter attached to the image the corresponding sound of that drum part would get played.

- "W" is Tom1  
- "A" is Tom2  
- "S" is Tom3  
- "D" is Tom4  
- "J" is Snare  
- "K" is Cymbal  
- "L" is Bass Drum  

## Lesson
In this Repository, I learnt about how to manupulate DOM objects, how to add events listeners to the webpage and how to add animation to the webpage. This was a challenge I completed successfully while taking the course.
